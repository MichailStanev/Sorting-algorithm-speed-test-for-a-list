# This is a program made to give the fastest sorthing algorithm for a specific list , written with JavaFX
# Note:
#    -> Only the "Test a List" tab is working at the moment
# Things to add:
#	 -> Information and pseudocode for each sorting algorithm in the "View Algorithms" tab.
# 	 -> Implementing the option to view old test results with the "Results" tab.
